# FeoFig
**_Front End Optimizer & Configurer_**
<br>
Turn your front-end optimization to a simplified task while maintaining readability using our figs!

## About
FeoFig is a one-stop-shop library for various front-end optimization techniques that developers can configure and apply to elements using "figs", single drop-in wrappers containing customized configuration settings. Once developers configure settings for multiple techniques in a separate "config" file, figs are ready to wrap around multiple elements that need to behave similarly.
